# KHE_Designer — Session STATE

> Owner: **KHE_Designer** (single-owner, no dev pair Phase 1).
> Scope: `docs/mockup_*.jsx` + `docs/teams/designer_STATE.md` only.
> Read-only on BRD/SRS — report DOCS_INBOX (#1) on spec gap, never edit canonical docs.
> Branch: `claude/design-system-m0`.

_Last updated: 2026-06-18 (Phase 1 approved; Phase 2 Admin screens built)_

## Decisions in force (design-relevant)
- **DEC-017** — Design System + mockups MUST land + Kevin-approve BEFORE Frontend
  (#30) / PWA (#31) code. Per-phase approval gate.
- **DEC-006** — Telegram bot as primary reminder channel (notification opt-in =
  deep-link, not Zalo).
- **DEC-012** — Concierge onboarding (≤20 SME) → upload screen needs a bulk mode.
- **D-07** — every extracted field must be user-editable with visible feedback
  (edit-in-place → Event); AI is not system of record.
- **D-08** — chat empty state MUST show "Không tìm thấy thông tin này trong hồ sơ
  của bạn." — never fabricate / suggest invented answers.
- **D-09** — firm portal read-only (M2+, not designed in M0).
- **FR-EX-05** — confidence + `needs_review` flag shown per field.

## Design tokens — source of truth
File `docs/mockup_design_system_v0.1.jsx` exports a `tokens` object (color,
typography, spacing on a 4px grid, radius, shadow, z-index). All later mockups
import/mirror these — do NOT redefine ad-hoc colors per screen.

Semantic color roles locked:
- `primary` — brand action (buttons, links, active nav)
- `success` — completed obligations, granted consent
- `warning` — `needs_review` badge, due-soon obligations
- `danger` — overdue obligations, destructive actions, revoked consent
- `info` — neutral notices, "đang xử lý" processing state
- `neutral` ramp — text, borders, surfaces (mobile-first contrast)

## Component library (Phase 1 — 8 components, done)
Built in `mockup_design_system_v0.1.jsx`:
1. **Button** — variants: primary / secondary / ghost / danger; sizes sm/md/lg; loading + disabled.
2. **Input** — label, hint, error, with optional inline edit affordance (D-07).
3. **Card** — surface container; header/body/footer slots.
4. **Table** — list/data table; status column friendly; mobile-stacked.
5. **Modal** — overlay dialog; used for consent (NĐ 13), confirm-destructive.
6. **Toast** — transient feedback (success/error/info); maps to Event-logged actions.
7. **Badge** — status pills; `needs_review` = warning, `confidence` = progress bar variant (FR-EX-05), doc status (processing/extracted/needs_review).
8. **EmptyState** — generic + the D-08 "Không tìm thấy" chat variant.

## Done
- [x] STEP 0 branch rename `claude/sweet-thompson-jixt9y` → `claude/design-system-m0`.
- [x] Cascade read: PRODUCT_STRATEGY v0.2 (personas/JTBD), BRD v0.3 (FR-IN/EX/OB/CQ/DR + §6 glossary), CLAUDE.md (D-rules + Decision Review Gate), #23 contract baseline, #24 task.
- [x] `docs/teams/designer_STATE.md` created.
- [x] **Phase 1** — `docs/mockup_design_system_v0.1.jsx` (tokens + 8 components + gallery showcase). **Kevin approved on #24.**
- [x] **Phase 2** — Admin 5 screens (all import Design System v0.1):
  - `mockup_admin_login_v0.1.jsx` — form {tenant_id, username, password} → POST /auth/login (#23)
  - `mockup_admin_upload_v0.1.jsx` — single drag-drop + bulk concierge ≤20 (DEC-012); FR-IN-01/03
  - `mockup_admin_document_list_v0.1.jsx` — status filter + search; FR-SR
  - `mockup_admin_document_detail_v0.1.jsx` — edit-in-place per field (D-07) + ConfidenceMeter + needs_review (FR-EX-05); obligations panel
  - `mockup_admin_obligation_v0.1.jsx` — urgency-bucketed due list, mark-done/hoãn → Event (FR-OB)

## Next (await Kevin approve Phase 2 first — DEC-017 gate)
- **Phase 3** — PWA 4 screens: login, chat (D-08 empty state), consent (NĐ 13/2023,
  text from KHE_Compliance #32), notification opt-in (Telegram deep-link).
- Each phase: commit → push → present to Kevin → await approve → next phase.

## Spec-gap watch (post DOCS_INBOX #1 if confirmed)
- Field list for document detail mockup pulled from BRD §6 Term + #23 per-tenant
  `terms` table. If a needed field is missing from the ratified schema during
  Phase 2 detail design, flag via DOCS_INBOX (do not self-resolve).
- `thoi_han_hd` phi-số ("vô thời hạn") state — BRD FR-OB-01 leaves policy open;
  Sprint 2 "Vô thời hạn" obligation display flagged but NOT designed in M0.

## Inbox
- issue #24 (`for:designer`, `task-assignment`, GATING #30 + #31) — Sprint 1
  Design System + M0 mockups. Status: Phase 1 done, awaiting Kevin approve.
